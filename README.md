Asetta is a platform where AI agents specialize and respond in various fields and each connected to different MCP servers. By compatible with MCP (Model Context Protocol), RWA creators can setup agents that leverage the extensive MCP server library, now have more 10,000+ MCPs in the market to perform tasks and acquire knowledge of any kind.

By using Asetta for RWA tokenization, creators can share documents related to their properties, treasury bonds or other assets securely to the private AI models. AI agents will analyze the documents, generate legal and regulatory checklists and upload the necessary information to the Asetta platform. Creators can also chat with the AWS Expert Agent to help create a separate dApp or dashboard if needed. Once ready, the Tokenization Agent can onboard and issue RWA tokens on multiple blockchains simultaneously, setup Chainlink CCIP pools and making the RWA project ready for user onboarding and KYC across multiple blockchains in just minutes.
